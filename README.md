**The Game Options:** 

In the game, you have the ability to choose five different options; rock, paper, scissors, lizard and spock. Each of the options can be clicked by the player and their chosen option appears. Player's choice is positioned on the left whilst computer's choice is positioned on the right.

**The Game Results:** 

When the player clicks one of the five options, the image of the option animates and the computer choice is revealed. The winner is then chosen with "player wins" or "computer wins" appearing above the animations. The score is then given to the winner. The results are demonstrated clearly and it is easy to determine whether the player or computer is in the lead. The JavaScript Code chooses randomly the computer option and generates an image for the computers choice and the winner is then selected.

**Features To Possibly Implement:** 

To enhance this game a total score that indicates the end of the game and directs you to the beginning of the game again would help the users experience.

## Bugs:

There was an issue with the options being generated in the game. For example when spock was chosen and the computer generated lizard, spock won. This was remedied in JavaScript by changing the if and else statements.
