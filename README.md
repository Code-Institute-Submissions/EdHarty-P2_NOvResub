ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS, LIZARD, SPOCK GAME 
The Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock Game, is a fun game that can be used to help indecisive people to come to a conclusion with regards to difficult choices. The game is geared towards both children and adults and it is simple and anyone can play.

Balsamiq:
I used balsamiq to give me a general idea of what the game should look like.

The Game Options: In the game, you have the ability to choose five different options; rock, paper, scissors, lizard and spock. Each of the options can be clicked by the player and their chosen option appears. Player's choice is positioned on the left whilst computer's choice is positioned on the right.

The Game Results: When the player clicks one of the five options, the image of the option animates and the computer choice is revealed. The winner is then chosen with "player wins" or "computer wins" appearing above the animations. The score is then given to the winner. The results are demonstrated clearly and it is easy to determine whether the player or computer is in the lead. The JavaScript Code chooses randomly the computer option and generates an image for the computers choice and the winner is then selected.

Features To Possibly Implement: When I have time, to enhance this game I would like to include a total score that indicates the end of the game and directs you to the beginning of the game again. 

TESTING: 

I tested this game on different browsers - Chrome, Mozilla, Microsoft edge.
I repeatedly played the game to ensure that all of the results were correct.
I confirmed that all of the HTML structure was legible and comprehendible.
I ensured the colours used were pleasing to the eye and did not obscure viewing.
I generated a lighthouse report for both mobile and desktop applications to confirm that it was running and functioned well.

Bugs:

I had an issue with the options being generated in the game. For example when I chose spock and the computer generated lizard, spock won. This was remedied in JavaScript by changing the if and else statements.

Validator testing:
I used Jshint to validate the JavaScript code.
